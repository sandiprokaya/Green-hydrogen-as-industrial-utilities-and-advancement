This is a set of conceptual models representing electrolysis, 
the conversion of electrical energy and water into hydrogen gas.
The interaction between solar photovoltaic, energy storage (battery) 
and electrolyzer is captured in green_hydrogen_Battery.slx.

Parameters in the model are set to capture a consistent physical behaviour 
but are not related to any specific commercial electrolyzer in particular.

Run Parameter_File.m first, prior to simulating the model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The implementation of the electrolyzer (Simscape language) is propietary of the author 
and MathWorks and hence not disclosed in this submission.

MathWorks offers licenses and Consulting services. Under a consulting framework,
collaboration may be established to build a tailored electrolysis unit.  
   
Any feedback would be really appreciated.
